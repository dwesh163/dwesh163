This change ensures that the correct accreditation ID is returned based on the provided email and gallery ID.\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/kooked-ch/pictures/commit/7510b64bc0c2bf95e9822e6a807a2ee74f459ff4\">7510b64</a>: fix: Fix email sending in next-auth.ts\n\nThe code changes in next-auth.ts fix a bug in the email sending logic.

This allows users to request a new verification email if they did not receive the initial one or if it expired. This commit adds the necessary logic to handle the resend request and sends a new verification email to the user.\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/kooked-ch/pictures/commit/81f1eff107fca454985783ed6297c702b5bbeb39\">81f1eff</a>: fix: Correctly compare account provider in next-auth.ts\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/kooked-ch/pictures/commit/3e893685da0a62f4ff2fe182cd00e3043fd90c07\">3e89368</a>: fix: Correctly compare account provider in next-auth.ts\n\nThe code changes in next-auth.ts fix a logical error in the conditional statement that compares the account provider. The previous code did not correctly compare the provider, resulting in incorrect behavior. This commit updates the condition to ensure that the account provider is compared correctly before returning a value.\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/kooked-ch/pictures/commit/ada14e9f288d31b927f5888f4c8a5a10892df2e7\">ada14e9</a>: fix: Update conditional statement in next-auth.ts to correctly compare account provider\n\nThe code changes in next-auth.ts fix a logical error in the conditional statement that compares the account provider.
